pyDome
======

A geodesic dome calculator written in Python.

pyDome calculates vertices and chords of Class One geodesic domes of arbitrary size. Domes created by pyDome can be truncated to facilitate structure design. The program produces DXF for easy import into CAD programs, and VRML output for easy display.

The overall method used to produce the geodesic domes is described on my blog at [designing a geodesic house](http://badassdatascience.com/2012/04/15/geodesic-dome-design-part-1/). The pyDome program is introduced on the same blog at [pyDome: a geodesic dome designer](http://badassdatascience.com/2013/12/05/pydome-a-geodesic-dome-designer/). This link explains the basic output of the program. Angle-related output is explained in a later blog post at [pyDome updates: tangential and spoke angles](http://badassdatascience.com/2014/06/15/pydome-updates-hub-angles/).
